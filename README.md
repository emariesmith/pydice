# pydice
A simple set of dice made solely with python.

The only thing you need for this project is python. It is a simple "pair of dice" made with easy to understand python code which can be altered and manipulated as you please. The GUI uses tkinter and it logs your rolls into a txt file so you can always look back and see what you did.

This is my first, working python application I've created so I welcome constructive criticism! But go easy on me :,)

Happy rolling!
